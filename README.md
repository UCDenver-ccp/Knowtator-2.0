## Features

### Annotation highlighting
Click on OWL class in Class hierarchy to select a term. Annotate the text by highlighting it and then clicking "Add TextAnnotation". 

### Load plain text documents

### Annotation profiles
Create textAnnotation profiles and assign them different colors. Switch between them quickly with by selecting them on the right.

### Save textAnnotations to XML file
Annotations can be saved as an XML file. This stores the textAnnotation instance, the text textSpan, the ontology term ID and the ontology term RDFS label.

### Reload textAnnotations
Annotations are reloaded and automatically highlight the text using the color of the current annotator.

## Known bugs
1. When the first ontology is loaded, all current work and profiles are lost.
2. When a new textAnnotation annotator is added, it is not displayed until view panes are resized.
3. Can only add textAnnotations to one document at a time since the textAnnotations do not yet know for which file they apply to.
4. Cannot turn off textAnnotation annotator to remove highlighting.
5. When Knowtator view is added, the split between panes is too far to the left.
6. Cannot remove textAnnotations or textAnnotation profiles.
