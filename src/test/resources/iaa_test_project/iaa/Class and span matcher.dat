This file is provided to facilitate cut-n-paste into a spreadsheet.
If you cannot directly copy the data below into a spreadsheet without it all going into a single cell,
then try copying to a text editor first and then copy it from there.  There is typically a 'paste special'
option under the Edit menu that will allow you to paste the copied data as text.  This will also work.
