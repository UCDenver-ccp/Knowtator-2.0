Dear {_name of collaborator_}-


I'd like to invite you to participate in the {_project name_} via the [abra-collaboratory reproducible research framework](https://github.com/callahantiff/Abra-Collaboratory) hosted on GitHub.

The [abra-collaboratory reproducible research framework](https://github.com/callahantiff/Abra-Collaboratory) will allow me to use GitHub as a one-stop-shop for all aspects of my project. It is my hope that we can use this repository to collaborate and interact on my project in the following ways:
  - [x] Detailed project documentation and decision tracking
  - [x] Documenting and archiving project meeting minutes
  - [x] Organizing to-do lists, issues, and keeping track of completed work
  - [x] Setting project milestones
 
**Getting Access to the GitHub Repository**  
If you already have a GitHub account, please send me your username so I can add you as a project collaborator.
If you are not yet on GitHub, please sign-up for an account [here](https://github.com/) and then send me your username so I can add you as a project collaborator.

**Once you are Added as a Collaborator**  
In order to help manage project notifications, I’d like to ask you to make an update to your settings. This change will make it so that you only get sent emails when you are specifically `@mentioned` or assigned to an issue or when big changes to the code base are made. This will prevent you from becoming annoyed with me by ensuring that you are only notified when something _ACTUALLY_ needs your attention.
To make this change, go to the “UnWatch” drop-down in the GitHub repository and change the default setting from “Watching” to “Releases only”. See screenshots [here](https://github.com/callahantiff/Abra-Collaboratory/wiki/Using-GitHub-as-a-Reproducible-Research-Platform#notifications).

**Getting Comfortable with the Repository**  
I strongly recommend you start by reading the [Abra-Collaboratory tutorial](https://github.com/callahantiff/Abra-Collaboratory/wiki/Using-GitHub-as-a-Reproducible-Research-Platform) on the project Wiki.  
Then, review the [Abra-Collaboratory guidelines](https://github.com/callahantiff/Abra-Collaboratory/wiki/Our-Reproducible-Repository-Guidelines-%F0%9F%98%83) (err, suggestions :smiley:) for collaboration.

Best-

{_Your Name Here_}
